The process begins with \"1. Goal and scope definition,\" which establishes the functional unit as 1 kg of methanol, defines the system boundary from cradle to gate, and specifies assumptions such as ignoring transportation cost impact (<1%) and allocating multiple products via extension, replacement, and partition. The second stage, \"2. Life cycle inventory (LCI),\" involves model construction and data collection, identifying inputs and outputs across the system. Key inputs include natural resources and raw materials/energy, while outputs encompass atmospheric emissions (e.g., CO2, CH4, SO2, NOX, NH3, H2O, CFC, PO4, COD, Hg), water discharge, soil discharge, and solid waste. The third stage, \"3. Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA),\" characterizes environmental impacts using indicators such as Global Warming Potential (GWP), Abiotic Depletion Potential (ADP), Acidification Potential (AP), Human Toxicity Potential (HTP), Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP), and Photochemical Oxidation Potential (POP). These indicators are aggregated into comprehensive indicators through weighting and normalized indices. The fourth stage, \"4. Life cycle interpretation,\" integrates inventory data and impact assessment results to perform improvement analysis, potential analysis, and scheme comparison and analysis, culminating in quantitative inspection and evaluation information and a final conclusion. The entire process is depicted as a sequential flow from goal definition through inventory, impact assessment, and interpretation, with feedback loops for improvement and analysis.",

This captured CO₂ is then transported to a processing facility where it undergoes chemical absorption for purification. The purified CO₂ is subsequently used in a synthesis process to produce methanol.\n\nThe synthesis of methanol from CO₂ involves several pathways, all of which require hydrogen (H₂) as a reactant. The hydrogen is generated through water electrolysis, a process powered by renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, geothermal, wave, tidal, and nuclear energy, as well as the electrical grid. The generated hydrogen is then combined with the captured CO₂ in different reaction systems to produce syngas, which is subsequently used in the methanol synthesis reactor. The pathways for this conversion include thermochemistry, photochemistry, and electrochemistry, each representing a distinct method for catalyzing the reaction between CO₂ and H₂.\n\nAfter the methanol synthesis step, the crude methanol is subjected to rectification, a purification process that separates and removes impurities and water to yield refined methanol. The overall process emphasizes the integration of CO₂ capture with renewable energy-driven hydrogen production to create a sustainable methanol synthesis pathway.",
