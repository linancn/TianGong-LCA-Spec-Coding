      "text": "In recent years, the rapid development of global new energy vehicle industry has brought severe challenges to the waste management of retired power batteries. How to minimise the environmental impact in the recovery process has become a common and emergent concern. In this study, Life Cycle Assessment Model (LCA) was applied to analyse the entire life cycle of Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries from the production, use, and recovery processes and compared the life cycle environmental impacts of different recovery technologies to determine the technology with the optimum overall environmental attributes. The critical process for reducing environmental impacts and the main contributing factors were identified by thoroughly evaluating the environmental impact of the recovery process and the reduction of the environmental impact in the production phase by using recycled products. The results show that the cascade utilisation technique has the optimum performance compared with the all-component physical method and hydrometallurgical recovery technology. The results also imply that the production phase has a relatively greater impact on the assessment results when the recovery phase is not considered, especially the use phase has no contribution to the ADP, while the production phase has a contribution of  $97.8\\%$ . Through the comprehensive comparison of different recovery technologies for lithium iron phosphate batteries, it is found that the environmental impact of the recovery phase can be improved by prioritising cascade utilisation, increasing the recovery rate, reducing the resource and energy consumption and pollution discharge in the recovery process, increasing the variety of recycled battery materials, and choosing the recycled products that can substitute for more production steps.",

In recent years, with the rapid development of global new energy vehicle industry, the output of power batteries, as the core component and power source of electric vehicles (EVs), is also increasing. By 2030, the annual capacity of retired power batteries is estimated to be 100-120 GWh worldwide (Miao et al., 2022). Among many power batteries, lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries are widely used to power electric vehicles because of their distinctive characteristics, including safety, relatively long cycle life, environmental friendliness, high energy density, high power density and few maintenance requirements (Scrosati and Garche, 2010; Xu et al., 2012). But power batteries are essentially energy-intensive products leading to significant energy demand and pollution emissions during material extraction, production, use and disposal stages.",

      "text": "The resource demands and environmental impacts associated with power batteries within the life cycle are key challenges that restricted the sustainable development of EVs. It is necessary to evaluate the environmental impact of power batteries in the whole life cycle. With regard to the battery, the life cycle assessment (LCA) is one of the most effective ways of exploring the resource and environmental impact of a battery's life cycle, a system of assessment has been developed by ISO 14040. It includes technical surveys of the battery life cycle stages, from material acquisition and manufacturing to use and end-of-life (Zackrisson et al., 2010).",

(2022) found that battery recycling can reduce the resource and environmental impact by  $5 - 30\\%$ , which was an effective means to reduce resource and environmental problems to achieve sustainable development. It could be found that most studies focused more on the battery production and first use phase in power batteries (Majeau-Bettez et al., 2011a,b; Quan et al., 2022), but few studies conducted in-depth analysis of theirs environmental impact that the recycling process exerts. This is mainly because the current power battery recycling technology is not yet mature (Xiao et al., 2019), and there exists some difficulties to obtain actual production data. However, the properly recycling of power batteries can largely reduce the environmental burden during these batteries' whole life cycle. Wang and Yu (2021) used LCA to speculate the environmental impact of lithium-ion battery, and found if waste lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) could be appropriately recycled, their life cycle environmental impact would be further dramatically decreased. Also, power batteries contain abundant metals that have a high economic value for recovery (Fan et al., 2020; Volesky, 1990), and they can trigger environmental pollution and cause pathogenic risks to human health without adequate recycling (Siqi et al., 2019).",

      "text": "Therefore, an assessment based on the LCA is required to specify the environmental impacts of power batteries from a whole life cycle perspective, especially in-depth research on the environmental impacts of power batteries in the recovery process. Echelon use, hydrometallurgical recycling, and pyrometallurgical recycling are the dominating techniques of recovery currently (Lv et al., 2018; Quan et al., 2022). Mohr et al. (2020) used a cell-chemistry specific LCA of LIBs recycling processes, and demonstrated the highest benefit is obtained via advanced hydrometallurgical treatment for lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide and lithium nickel cobalt aluminum oxide-type batteries, but this analysis did not include LFP batteries. Hao et al. (2017) observed that hydrometallurgical recycling of lithium-ion nickel-cobalt-manganese (NCM) batteries could achieve a  $34\\%$  reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, but the comparison of recycling technologies was not carried out. In fact, in most related research, usually only one type of recycling technology is studied, and comparative studies on the LCA of multiple recycling technologies are lacking. Yang et al. (2022) found that the LFP battery was more environmentally friendly in the global warming potential (GWP) and acidification potential (AP), while the NCM battery was more environmentally friendly in abiotic depletion (fossil) (ADP(f)) and human toxicity potential (HTP). The research object included LFP, but environmental impact indices lacked primary energy depletion (PED), eutrophication potential (EP) and environmental in organics (RI). Similarly, Quan et al. (2022) compared different recovery technologies for LFP batteries and concluded that hydrometallurgy was recommended for recycling waste LFP batteries by better environmental advantages than pyrometallurgy and direct physical recycling, but the environmental impact categories shown on recovery technologies were not comprehensive.",

Specifically, when capacity reaches less than  $80\\%$ , decommissioned power batteries can be used in echelon, that is, in other energy storage fields or equipment with low requirements for battery capacity (Zhang et al., 2020).
